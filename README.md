## Stoic Framework

> The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately. - Seneca

Stoic - is my personal PHP framework, which I develop in order to better understand the low-level architecture of modern web frameworks. 
And to brag about it, of course ðŸ™Œ

## Features

- routing
- error handling
- custom event listeners
- dependency injection
- testing
- MVC-ready
- template manager

... and more in the future.

## Installation

Stoic requires [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to run.
Make sure you have them installed before moving on.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:IvanVovchok/stoic-framework.git
```

Go to the project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
cd stoic-framework
composer install
```

Start the application:

```sh
cd public
php -S localhost:8000
```

Have fun!
